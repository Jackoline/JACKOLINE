It hasn't been easy, but then again, nothing worth having ever is. We have faced many challenges and setbacks, but we have always found a way to move forward.India is one of the largest consumers of water in the world, and it has serious water problems. Up to 80% of the water that is used in India is used for agriculture. This water is inefficiently used, and is a major contributor to water pollution and water shortages. Because of this, many parts of India have poor access to clean water.Today, Jackoline is one of the largest independent pipe line company in the country. It has been a long journey to get here, but we are proud of our accomplishments. It hasn't been easy, but then again, nothing worth having ever is.

    <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Providing Clean supply of Water to Hubli Airport with 660mm dia HS pipe is one of our most important projects. The great thing about it is that it was a simple idea that turned into a complex build. We can now supply water to the entire airport, which is a significant achievement for us.Over the years, we’ve used a lot of different pipes, but nothing compared to the 660mm diameter high-strength pipe we used to provide water supply to the airport in the city of Hubli in India. It was a big moment for us and our team. It showed that we can make a real impact when we come together and work as a team. &nbsp <b>(Location-Hubli,India)</b></p><br><br>
